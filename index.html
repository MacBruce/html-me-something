      <h3>Information about me</h3>
      <p>My name is Mackenzie V. Bruce, I am a web developer from Seattle,
        Washington. I initially became intersted in web development when I
        realized that I would like to create an online business, only then did I
        learn that I had a passion for developing solutions to problems I
        didn't know existed.</p>

       alt="SantaClara" /> I recently took a trip to San Francisco,
      CA. On the trip we ventured out to Googles headquarters in Moutain View
      and I have always had a lot of love for this area. I would love the
      opportunity to live and work in Santa Clara, CA. It's a beautiful area,
      innovative tech hub and not grey and dreary like here in Seattle, WA.</p>
